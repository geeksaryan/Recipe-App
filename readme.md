# Recipe App

The **Recipe App** is a web-based application that allows users to search for recipes by meal name. It fetches data from the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/) and displays detailed information about recipes, including ingredients, instructions, and meal categories. The app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for food enthusiasts to explore and learn new recipes.
